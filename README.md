iBogorKab is a redesign project for the digital library application serving the Bogor region. This UI redesign initiative aims to modernize the existing application using Jetpack Compose, improving both the visual appeal and user experience. The application enables users to browse, borrow, read, and manage their e-book collection directly from their Android devices.


## About The Redesign

- Implementing a modern, material-based design language
- Creating a more intuitive user flow
- Rebuilding all screens using Jetpack Compose for better performance and maintainability

- Enhancing visual consistency throughout the application

The current implementation focuses on the UI layer, with the intention of integrating with existing backend systems in future development phases.
